I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Shanghai University of Electric Power, specializing in Trustworthy Machine Learning and Computer Vision. My research focuses on security challenges in Federated Learning, particularly backdoor attacks and defenses.

I am seeking Ph.D. positions for 2026 admission, with strong interest in Trustworthy ML.
