Hi! I’m **Qingqian Yang**, a Master’s student in **Computer Science** at **Shanghai University of Electric Power**, advised by [Prof. Liangliang Wang](https://jsjxy.shiep.edu.cn/b6/e0/c1044a177888/page.htm).
Currently, I am an **intern at Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, working in the **Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems**, where I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Tao Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tIjK-3QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Prof. Yang Hua](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/yang-hua/), and [Prof. Hao Wang](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/hwang9).

My research focuses on **Trustworthy Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**, particularly on security challenges in Federated Learning, such as backdoor attacks and defenses.  
I am broadly interested in building reliable, robust, and interpretable AI systems.

I am looking for a **PhD position for Fall 2026**!
