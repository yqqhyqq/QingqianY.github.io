Hi! I’m **Qingqian Yang**, a Master’s student in **Computer Science** at **Shanghai University of Electric Power**, advised by Prof. Liangliang Wang.  
Currently, I am an **intern at Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, working in the **Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems**, where I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Tao Song, Prof. Yang Hua, and Prof. Hao Wang.

My research focuses on Trustworthy Machine Learning and Computer Vision, particularly on security challenges in Federated Learning, such as backdoor attacks and defenses.  
I am broadly interested in building eliable, robust, and interpretable AI systems.

I am looking for a **PhD position for Fall 2026**!
